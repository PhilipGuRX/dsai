# Stage 3: How My Formatting Instructions Were Applied

**How your formatting instructions were applied in the generated README:**

1. **Emoji-prefixed section headers** — Each main section uses the icons from the rule: `## 📋 Overview`, `## 🔧 Setup`, `## 🚀 Usage`, `## 📦 Data Structure`, `## ⚠️ Troubleshooting`, and `## 🔗 Related`. This matches the icon-to-purpose mapping defined in the rule.

2. **Code blocks** — All code blocks use fenced triple backticks with explicit language tags (` ```python `, ` ```bash `). No indented blocks appear. A brief explanation sits above or below each block, per the rule.

3. **File references** — Internal files use the format `` [`filename.ext`](path) `` with the filename in backticks as link text. External links use descriptive text (e.g., "Census API Documentation") rather than raw URLs.

4. **Tables** — Structured information (variables, parameters, troubleshooting) is presented in Markdown tables instead of long bullet lists, as specified in the rule.

5. **Tone and style** — The README is direct and concise, avoids phrases like "obviously" or "it is critical," uses **bold** for key terms on first use, and uses `inline code` for commands, variables, and parameters.
